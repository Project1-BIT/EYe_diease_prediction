    This is a detailed image analysis of the uploaded eye image. The image contains key characteristics that could help identify various eye diseases, including but not limited to, cross eyes, conjunctivitis, cataracts, glaucoma, or uveitis. 
    It is crucial to analyze these conditions as they can affect vision and overall eye health. In particular, conditions like glaucoma may not present immediate symptoms but can lead to vision loss if untreated. 
    Cataracts cause blurry or cloudy vision, and uveitis is often associated with inflammation, leading to symptoms like eye redness and pain. Early detection through eye images can provide vital information for healthcare providers to make informed decisions.
    By analyzing the current image, we can attempt to identify symptoms that match any of these conditions. A closer examination of pupil alignment, eye redness, and discharge can give critical insights.
